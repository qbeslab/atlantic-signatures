ROBOT TRAINING
- Start at the following location with the "index" file
C:\Users\bkt2\Desktop\atlantic_signatures_create\atlantic_signatures_create\atlantic-signatures\docs\_build\html

- for 3/25/2022 - use pi as the name of the pi, and "qbes" as the password

For the Pi on the create
 - on the host computer, make sure that the computer is connected to the lab wireless network
 - in the command prompt on the host computer, ping /4 "hostname" (the hostname is the thing that you entered in the rpi setup.local)
     - you should get back whether its connected, and that the device is connected
  - open Putty
  - enter the ip address that's on the pi itself

ON THE HOST COMPUTER
- On the host computer,  go to the directory where things have been downloaded to from the command prompt (C:\Users\bkt2\Desktop\atlantic_signatures_create\atlantic_signatures_create)

-  do "scp -rp atlantic-signatures pi@RPI3.local:/home/pi/atlantic_signatures" enter the pi's password when prompted

- For Anaconda on the host computer (using anaconda prompt)
  - navigate to C:\Users\bkt2\Desktop\atlantic_signatures_create\atlantic_signatures_create\atlantic-signatures
   - pip install pyserial
   - pip install pint

ON THE PI (through putty)
  - go into the project that you scp'd over (i.e., cd the_project_name)
  - run each of the lines

python -m venv /home/pi/atlantic_signatures/venv
cp -r /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/numpy* /home/pi/atlantic_signatures/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/
*alternatively, you could do  cp -r /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/numpy* ./venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/

cp -r /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/serial* /home/pi/atlantic_signatures/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/
*alternatively, you could do  cp -r /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/serial* ./venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/

source /home/pi/atlantic_signatures/venv/bin/activate
pip install /home/pi/atlantic_signatures/setup-files/Pint-0.18-py2.py3-none-any.whl --no-deps
python /home/pi/atlantic_signatures/setup.py install

ON THE HOST COMPUTER
   - python setup.py install

ON THE CREATE THROUGH PUTTY
- atlantic_signatures run (run this FIRST, count to 5, then run the same thing with a config file specified on the host computer

ON THE HOST COMPUTER
   - atlantic_signatures run --file=Test-1.cfg (run this AFTER running the same thing on the create)

TO CLOSE, ON THE PI THROUGH PUTTY
- sudo shutdown -h now (you WILL get a fatal error from putty, and  that is ok and good)
