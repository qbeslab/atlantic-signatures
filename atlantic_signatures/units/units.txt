#### BASE UNITS ####
meter = [length] = m = metre
degree = [] = deg = °
second = [time] = s = sec


#### DERIVED UNITS #####

# Units of length
inch = yard / 36 = in = inches
foot = yard / 3 = ft = feet
yard = 0.9144 * meter = yd
mile = 1760 * yard = mi

# Units of angles
radian = 180 * degree / π = rad

# Units of time
minute = 60 * second = min
hour = 60 * minute = hr
day = 24 * hour


#### DERIVED UNIT CONVERSIONS #####

# Velocity
mph = mile / hour = miles_per_hour
kph = kilometer / hour = kilometers_per_hour
fps = feet / second = feet_per_second
mps = meter / second = meters_per_second

# Angular velocity
degree_per_second = degree / second
radian_per_second = radian / second


#### CONSTANTS ####

# At 5 decimal places, the below approximation of pi introduces an error of
# 0.00015 degrees into calculations of angle which is more than adequate.
pi = 3.14159 = π
