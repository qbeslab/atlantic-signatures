Configuring Vicon Tracker Objects
=================================

.. todo::

    Finish this guide on how to make Vicon objects, and create backups of them.

Today I learned how to adjust the position and orientation of the object origin and axes within an Object model.
    #. Select the Object you want to adjust.
    #. Press the Pause button (not the Go Offline button) to enable clicking on the object axes.
    #. You can then select the red, green, or blue object axes. Click and drag to translate the Object's center; click again to switch to rotation mode, and drag one of the circles to change the orientation of the axes.
    #. If you have one marker selected, translation and rotation can snap to it.

So, I went back and did the following to the Objects I created on 2025-02-26:
    #. I colored the front-mounted marker red (Rudolph).
    #. I colored the central marker gray.
    #. I selected the central marker, then centered the Object model on it by translating and snapping all three axes to the central marker.
    #. I selected the front-mounted marker, then oriented the red x-axis (forward vector for our robot) by rotating (about the blue z-axis) until the red vector snapped to the front-mounted marker.
